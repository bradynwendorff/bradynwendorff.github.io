    <p>Ranchers: <br/>
        -   How cold will it get overnight, and will I need to bed the animals <br/>
        -	Do I need to supplement the cattle feed for the cold <br/>
        -	Will I need to break the ice on the water trough

    <h3>Persona 1</h3>
    <p>Joe Harder, age 66. He grew up farming with his grandfather and father. He now manages the farm and ensures the animals and crops are taken care of. His yearly salary depends greatly on the crops and prices of cattle. It also depends greatly on the weather and how he is prepared for it.<br/>
    Joe is married to his wife Hallie. They like to go boating during the summer evenings after the work is all taken care of. </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Persona 2</h3>
    <p>Jerry Appleton, aged 35. From his childhood Jerry has been tasked with responsibility in managing and maintaining the ranch. As soon as he could sit up on a horse he was out riding among the cattle. He even was given an opportunity to bottle feed one of the calves who's mother had died and fell in love with the animals. <br/>
    He loves to ride horses and has taken up riding bronk. He loves to compete with others in many different rodeo competitions as his skills have been tuned since childhood. He does all this as he prepares to take over the family ranch as he works to buy the property and cattle from his father.</p>
