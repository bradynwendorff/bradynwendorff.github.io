                <h2>The Year Rain Was Deperately Needed</h2>
                <p>The year is 2017 and the prairies were parched. The grasses and grains in the 
                    farmer's fields was all dried up. The summer was an unusually hot summer and 
                    the heat and dry conditions had southern Alberta on edge. Every few days another 
                    fire would spark and the fight would be on to beat the hot, dry, windy conditions
                    and the fires. Many people had their vehicles packed to evacuate at a moment's notice.
                    Then it happened. The dry lighting storm had sparked up a fire which became big enough 
                    that it created it's own winds pushing it forward at an increadable speed. It was at this
                    time that the small town of Waterton became a critical location and fire threatened to wipe
                    out the town and the beautiful Waterton National Park. As the days went on the fire became 
                    bigger and bigger until the town was evacuated and the fire crews from several different cities, and
                    municipalities converged on the town to protect it as best they could. The town was created with only one road in and out of it with the mountains 
                    on the other 3 side. The fire crew prepared water line, sprinkers, and every other means they
                    could to be prepared for the fire. They were informed that they were to protect the town until 
                    the first building ignited. On the first building on fire they were all to evacuate the town
                    and leave it to the fire to completely wipe out everything in it's path....   <br/>     Story to be continued
                    in next week's announcements.
