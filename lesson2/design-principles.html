            <div class="grid-item"><h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
                <h4>Cessna Textron Aviation</h4>
                    <a href="https://cessna.txtav.com">https://cessna.txtav.com</a>

                    <br/><br/>
                    <h6>I chose Cessna as a great example of a good use of white space and clean design because the site is just that. As I scrolled down the page on one side is a small picture and on the other side is plenty of white space with a little text in it. They did not try to throw too much words into it, but kept it clean with a ‘Read More’ button if the person wants to read more about the aircraft. </h6>

                    <div class="grid-item"><h3>Contrast</h3>
                    <h4>Van's Aircraft</h4>
                    <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/">https://www.vansaircraft.com</a>
                     <br/><br/>
                     <img src="images/vans.png"  alt="Van's Aircraft">
                     <br/><br/>
                     <h6>I chose Van’s Aircraft as a great sight with plenty of great contrast. As you see the page initially it has a dark background picture with some beautiful brilliant colored aircraft. Scrolling down it change between white on black text and white on orange text. The pictures do a brilliant job at making the website ‘pop’ with the contrast of colors.</h6>
                     </div>
                     <div class="grid-item"><h3>Alignment</h3>
                     <h4>Best Kiteboarding</h4>
                     <a href="https://www.bestkiteboarding.com/en-us/">https://www.bestkiteboarding.com</a>
                     <br/><br/>
                     <img src="images/bestkitboarding.png"  alt="Best Kiteboarding">
                     <br/><br/>
                     <h6>Best Kiteboarding's website was my pick for alignment because they do a great job at aligning items on their site. As someone drills down into the website it displays a great job of using columns, or the likes of them. They are aligned vertically and horizontally which make the site easier to navigate and also looks.</h6>
